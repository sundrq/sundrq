# Hi and welcome! 🌙

✦🔴✦ My name is Sandra and I'm a beginner junior developer and a student. Next year I'm going to pass into the high level course of software development in my college.

✦🔴✦ Currently I'm busy with repeating everything I've learned two years ago, because I did a pause. Namely: HTML (50% on Codecademy), JavaScript (57% on Codecademy). 

✦🔴✦ I also had experience with CSS (HTML&CSS), C# (10% on Codecademy).

✦🔴✦ Currently, I have a task to catch up on all the knowledge in HTML and start learning Python.
